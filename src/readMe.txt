The Interactive Web Map tool is an open source project developed by Cengiz Arslan (https://github.com/c-arslan-wur/interactive-web-map) under Task 4.2 of the EU H2020 REST-COAST Project (https://rest-coast.eu/).

The tool supports local communities, governmental bodies, managers, scientists, policymakers... in participatively applying the two fundamental methods-the Participatory Downscaling Approach and the Input-Process-Output Model-of the NB3 Framework that was collaboratively developed with nine coastal restoration pilots of the REST-COAST Project.

The framework guides the stakeholders in identifying smaller, homogenours units as NbS-driven building blocks, that are locally-relevant and integrated across biophysical, ecological, and socio-economic dimensions. These building blocks constitute a portfolio of restoration units that inform potential upscaling strategies across larger landscapes through synergies and harmonies across scale and time.

For detailed information about the NB3 Framework, please refer to:

3. Scientific article on the participative application of the framework: C. Arslan, J. Warner & J.M. van Loon-Steensma (2026), Participative application of the nature-based building blocks (NB3) framework to support upscaling coastal NbS, Ocean & Coastal Management, 272, 107988. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2025.107988

Data and knowledge from the participative application of the framework in the REST-COAST project is being published as a collective data paper format as an examplary of the inventory on NbS-driven building blocks in the Ebro Delta, Foros Bay, Venice Lagoon, and Vistula Lagoon pilots:

4. Dataset for Physical, Social, and Ecological Characteristics of Coastal Units at four coastal restoration pilots across EU:
	C. Arslan, Earth Systems and Global Change Group, Wageningen University & Research (Framework development)
	J.M. van Loon-Steensma, Earth Systems and Global Change Group, Wageningen University & Research (Task owner & Framework development)
	Elisa Furlan, CMCC (Venice Lagoon Pilot)
	Fabienne Horneman, CMCC (Venice Lagoon Pilot)
	Alice Stocco, Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Venice Lagoon Pilot)
	Laura Puertolas, Albirem (Ebro Delta Pilot)
	Nil Alvarez, Eurecat (Ebro Delta Pilot)
	Elista Hineva, IO-BAS (Foros Bay Pilot)
	Nataliya Andreeva, IO-BAS (Foros Bay Pilot)
	Grzegorz Rozynski, IBW-PAN (Vistula Lagoon Pilot)

This data across the four pilots is embedded in the tool, which can be initialized by loading the REST-COAST project.

The framework and the associated Interactive Web Map tool can be extended beyond coastal and EU scope, contributing to the upscaling efforts for the NbS-driven restoration strategies across diverse landscapes and contexts. The tool promotes this through;
- a possibility to launch a blank map as the basis for the Participtive Downscaling Approach across any landscape, and
- an embedded data from the sister project Waterlands to showcase the application of the framework beyond coastal scope, i.e. peatlands and wet forests.

It is important to note that both the framework and its associated Interactive Web Map tool are living processes, transient metabolites of continuous co-development efforts, holding potential to adaptively grow across effective and balanced participation. So, the framework should be regarded as a capacity building and mutual learning tool in the toolbox of Communities of Practice in upscaling NbS implementation.
